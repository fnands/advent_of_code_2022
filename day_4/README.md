# Day 4

## Key Lessons
* Julia supports unicode character as variable names, which is fun, but silly
* Piping (`|>`) is pretty convenient for making one-liners
* Piping is broadcast with `.|>`
* Math operators for intersection and union (`∩` and `∪`) are supported
* Need to figure out how chaining functions with `∘` works

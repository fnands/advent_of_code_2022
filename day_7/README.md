# Day 7

## Key Lessons
* Queues and Stacks implemented in `DataStructures`. Works pretty much as expected with easy syntax. 
* `tryparse(T, "string")` will try to parse some string into type `T`. Will return number if it works, otherwise `nothing`
* `nothing` is the Julia equivalent of Python's `None`

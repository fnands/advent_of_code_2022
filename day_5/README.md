# Day 5

## Key Lessons
* `collect` will turn an iterator or collection (in this case a String) into an Array.
* `getindex` is same as just indexing, but can be piped
* `filter` will apply selection on collection and apply only items that pass
* `reduce` will apply an operation to all elements of a collection and return a reduced object, here a Vector of Vectors is turned into an array with `hcat`
